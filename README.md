# Python-Project6-Hangman-
## About the Project  

Hangman is a simple word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.  

This project is implemented in Python and includes multiple difficulty levels, input validation, and an ASCII-based hangman drawing to visualize progress.  

Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to test vocabulary and logical thinking skills!
